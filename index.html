            <p>Hi! My name is Sheena Hamilton, I'm from Alberta, Canada and currently we have quite a bit of snow. I have 4 kids who love the snow and go skiing often. Usually by mid March we're all ready for spring to come! So far this year we haven't had too bad a cold snap (where it's -40 C for weeks!), but the month is still early and January - February is usually our coldest months.</p>

            <p>A little about myself, I have a lot of programming experience but I have been at home with my kids for the past 13 years. With that long of a break in my programming experience I have enrolled in school to refresh my skills and learn a few new languages. Change happens quickly in this industry, from the tools used to develop and communicate, versioning, development methodologies, and the popular languages. So far it's been a huge help to get me back on track.</p>
