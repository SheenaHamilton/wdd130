                Tips
                <br><br>
        
                1.	Macarons need to be kept refrigerated. They are fine to have out at room temperature for a couple hours if they're on display, but avoid leaving them out, especially if it's warm! Not that we have to worry about that right now. 
                <br><br>
                2.	Macarons are best enjoyed at room temperature. If you're too impatient and eat them straight from the fridge or freezer, they can be crunchy and hard. Wait about 15 minutes out of the fridge, and about 30 minutes out of the freezer. 
                <br><br>
                3.	Keep your macs in an airtight container in the fridge and freezer. We don't want these delicate cookies drying out, or getting condensation built up in their container. My clear 12 pack boxes are airtight, so they are fine to be put in the fridge as is. Technically you can also freeze them as is too, but I always put the whole box into a large freezer ziplock bag first. Just to be safe. My 6 pack boxes are not airtight, so you can either put the whole box into a ziplock bag first, or just take them out of the box and put them into another airtight container. Or just eat them in one sitting! 
                <br><br>
                4.	If you aren't going to be eating your macarons within 5 days of picking them up, freeze em. The fresher the better, so when in doubt, freeze them until you need them. I've kept macarons frozen for 3-4 months and they came out perfectly fine! As long as they're in an airtight something!! 
                <br><br>
                Most importantly, enjoy! These cookies are a labor of love, and I want them to make people as happy as they make me!
