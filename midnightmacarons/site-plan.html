      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to create a place that is designed to showcase the macarons and offer information such as ordering, pickup & delivery policies, prices, and flavours. Facebook has been a great place to advertise and promote the product but a more structured site is needed for potential customers to find all the information they need that is well organised and easy to navigate.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is mostly Edmonton and surrounding areas. Special events such as valentines day, birthdays, weddings, and other smaller occasions are quite popular with macarons. These are very popular with the age groups of 20 - 35. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to Midnight Macarons, a little bit about myself, I'm a mom to 3 wonderful little girls, Brynn and my twins Lennon and Margot, I also work part time as a dental hygienist and part time stay at home mom. I learned the art of baking Macarons during maternity leave with my first child Brynn. Most times with kids it can be hard to find a moment during the day to work on my art and therefore, the reason for “Midnight”. Oftentimes, it is midnight when I'm baking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to make Macarons, and I'm so excited to be able to share this delicious treat with you! I hope you love them as much as I do!

        Tips
        <br><br>

        1.	Macarons need to be kept refrigerated. They are fine to have out at room temperature for a couple hours if they're on display, but avoid leaving them out, especially if it's warm! Not that we have to worry about that right now. 
        <br><br>
        2.	Macarons are best enjoyed at room temperature. If you're too impatient and eat them straight from the fridge or freezer, they can be crunchy and hard. Wait about 15 minutes out of the fridge, and about 30 minutes out of the freezer. 
        <br><br>
        3.	Keep your macs in an airtight container in the fridge and freezer. We don't want these delicate cookies drying out, or getting condensation built up in their container. My clear 12 pack boxes are airtight, so they are fine to be put in the fridge as is. Technically you can also freeze them as is too, but I always put the whole box into a large freezer ziplock bag first. Just to be safe. My 6 pack boxes are not airtight, so you can either put the whole box into a ziplock bag first, or just take them out of the box and put them into another airtight container. Or just eat them in one sitting! 
        <br><br>
        4.	If you aren't going to be eating your macarons within 5 days of picking them up, freeze em. The fresher the better, so when in doubt, freeze them until you need them. I've kept macarons frozen for 3-4 months and they came out perfectly fine! As long as they're in an airtight something!! 
        <br><br>
        Most importantly, enjoy! These cookies are a labor of love, and I want them to make people as happy as they make me!
